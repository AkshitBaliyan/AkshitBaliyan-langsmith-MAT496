# AkshitBaliyan-langsmith-MAT496



I began by downloading the initial notebook from the repository and setting up the LangSmith API key along with an OpenAI key
Installed all required dependencies including scikit-learn, pandas, BeautifulSoup, and others.

The setup worked smoothly with no errors, so I proceeded to Module 1.


MODULE 1

Video 1:
Each execution of the code generates a new trace. Traces record every function call, providing a detailed step-by-step breakdown of how the program runs. The LangSmith platform offers an intuitive UI to view these traces and the functions involved. Metadata about each run can also be stored and displayed in the traceâ€”either added manually or during runtime. Both approaches were explored in the exercise.
